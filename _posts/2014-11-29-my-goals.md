I've always wanted to learn to code, but I never really considered it an option, being under the impression that you had to have majored in or gotten your MS in Computer Science. A second challenge was when would I have the time, given I had a full time job at a marketing or PR agency. Only when I threw myself into the startup world, during my time at the tech accelerator I was accepted into, did I realize that coding is a skill that can be self-taught. Now that I have the time and the financial stability to undertake a new project, my goals are the following:

* To be able to code unguided by additional materials and cheat sheets  
* To really understand the "why" and "how" of web development
* Ultimately to work with a great team building big things, and not have to always be the "PR girl"
* Learn a skill of the future - why be left behind in a future when a majority of the population will know how to code?
