title: Biggest Challenges
---
Some of my biggest challenges are:

* Failure to begin - I have a tendency (throughout high school and college too) to put things off, and cram!
* Creating a schedule for homework and learning is difficult, especially with client work
* Sometimes bloc skips over basic concepts and I feel lost
