title: My Experience with Bloc
---
My experience has been really wonderful. I signed up and based on online reviews I really didn't know what to expect. But it's been an excellent way to learn and is conducive to my learning style, which is casual, at times slow, and at times rushed. It allows me to go at my own pace.

My favorite things about Bloc?

* Suited for many different learning styles
* Flexible pace
* Loads of support from your mentor and others in the community
* Their tools are simple, efficient, and lean
