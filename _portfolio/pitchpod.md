short-description: Pitchpod is a thought leader's dream come true.

---
* Summary:
 [PitchPod](http://www.pitchpod.co) is the world's first media management tool for thought leaders.
* Explanation:
I built this with my programmer in Poland, a wonderful female coder. She developed this using Wordpress and I researched and selected thousands of podcast contacts to add to the database.
* Problem:
There are several media databases that store and track journalists and reporters, used by top PR agencies. But they are price, and what's more, they don't have good quality podcast contacts. Where does a real estate expert, tax star, startup, or developer guru go when they want to be booked on podcasts?
* Solution:
PitchPod solves this by giving you a database of podcast contacts - folks you want to pitch and get booked for interviews. Become a thought leader - fast!
* Results:
Early feedback has been fantastic and we have collected multiple testimonials from super happy thought leaders.
* Conclusion:
It works!
