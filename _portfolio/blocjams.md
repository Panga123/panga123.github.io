 short-description: BlocJams is like a tiny baby Spotify.

* Summary:
 BlocJams is a simple music player. It's like a tiny baby Spotify, except without all of the bells and the whistles. It solves the problems that are inherent in complex music players.
* Explanation:
I created this in order to keep up with my coursework at Bloc. Boy was it hard and at times I wanted to claw my eyes out.
* Problem:
It is so difficult to use Spotify because there are so many elements to pick from. What to listen to? Where to click? It's maddening. How can a person handle so much great music, such beautiful design, and such an incredible amount of selections?
* Solution:
BlocJams solves this by giving you just 3 songs and 3 buttons. Perfect. Simple. Solution.
* Results:
We're now up to 3 million users. It seems there are a lot of folks who want to be able to play just 3 songs, all day long.
* Conclusion:
It works!
